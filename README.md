# Car-Eval-using-Naive-Bayes

=>The model evaluates cars according to the following concept structure:

   buying             buying products
   maint              price of the maintenance
   doors              number of doors
   persons            capacity in terms of persons to carry
   lug_boot           the size of luggage boot
   safety              estimated safety of the car
   
=>The Car Evaluation Database contains  

->Attributes: buying, maint, doors, persons, lug_boot, safety.
  
->Number of Instances: 1728
   
->Number of Attributes: 6

->Attribute Values:
   buying       v-high, high, med, low
   maint        v-high, high, med, low
   doors        2, 3, 4, 5-more
   persons      2, 4, more
   lug_boot     small, med, big
   safety       low, med, high
